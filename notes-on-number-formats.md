Notes on number formats

* +1 and -1 must either both be numbers or both be symbols.
* it makes sense (for a language focussed on performance) to have a parse-time literal form for all numerical types.
* for compatibility with S-expressions generated by other languages, we should parse all "normal" ASCII representations of numbers.

So:

+1 => signed int
-1 => signed int
15.6 => 1.560000E+01
4.246e-13 => double value
-4.246e-13 => double value

parse rules:

[+-] NUMERIC => int
[+-] NUMERIC+'.'+NUMERIC => float
[+-] NUMERIC+'.'+NUMERIC [eE] [+-] NUMERIC+'.'+NUMERIC => float

Tested in both common lisp and scheme (clisp and gambit) that while trying to use `+5` as a symbol is disallowed, `+5a` *is* a valid symbol. If compatibility with the data structures output by these languages *is* a priority, then we must handle these structures.

Actually, that objective is rather foolish. We, by definition, are *not* supporting all the features of these languages, so we should abandon support for even parsing their code or outputs not specifically designed for minimalisp, especially where such features add complexity of this sort to the parse phase.

So, while `+a` is a valid minimalisp symbol, and `+5` is a valid number, `+5a` is a syntax error, because we assume it's a number and it isn't. This way, we only need to go as far as the 2nd character of the type to determine whether this is a symbol or a number.
